# DAG-editor
An idea to build an editor to draw DAG. Needs work to be done.
</br>
The application currently tracs users finger point and converts the drawn patterns to selected shapes.
It creates a center point for all the shapes. Lines or connectors are accepted between nodes if the connections are valid.
For example, connection without nodes is not accepted.

To launch the project, download the code and open main.lua file in the Corona Simulator.
